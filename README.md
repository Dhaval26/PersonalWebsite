# Personal Website

This repository contains a minimal example for creating your own static website.
It includes a simple home page and a blog page. You can modify the HTML files
and add your content.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` to edit your personal details:
   - Add a short introduction, list your skills, and describe your education.
2. Open `blog.html` to create blog posts related to networking and AI.
   - Duplicate the `<article>` block for each new post and update the title,
     date, and content.
3. Style the pages by editing `style.css` or adding your own CSS.
4. Serve the files locally by opening them in a browser or using a local
   web server, for example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Feel free to expand this project further or integrate it with a
static site generator or hosting platform.
